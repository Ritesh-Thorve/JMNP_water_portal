# 💧 My JMNP Water Portal

A modern, responsive web application built for Jalgaon Mahanagar Palika to streamline water-related services such as user queries, issue reporting, and official communication. This project is developed purely for learning purposes using modern technologies like Next.js, Appwrite, Redux, Tailwind CSS, and advanced JavaScript concepts.

## 🎯 Project Aim – Solving Real-World Problems

This project aims to digitize the water grievance redressal system for Jalgaon citizens. In many Indian cities, water complaints are often handled manually through phone calls, physical visits, or paperwork. This leads to delays, lack of transparency, and inefficient resolution.

**My Jalgaon Water Portal** solves this by:
- Allowing citizens to submit issues online with images.
- Providing a transparent view of complaint status.
- Enabling Jalgaon Mahanagar Palika officials to manage, respond, and update queries efficiently through a dedicated dashboard.
- Posting important water supply-related announcements for public awareness.
- Solves the problem of getting any news related to water supply very easily
- Reduces the dependency upon newspapers

It delivers results by streamlining communication, reducing response time, improving service tracking, and enabling easy access to information.
